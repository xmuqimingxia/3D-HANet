# 3D-HANet: A Flexible 3D Heatmap Auxiliary Network for Object Detection

3D HANet is a flexible plug-and-play Auxiliary Network. Although our open source code is based on the CasA detector, it can be verified with simple modifications to other detectors.

Please refer to [CasA](https://github.com/hailanyi/CasA) and [OpenPCDET](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) for the configuration of the code running environment and training of the model.

Replace the [CasA/pcdet](https://github.com/hailanyi/CasA/tree/master/pcdet) folder in CasA with the [3DHANet/pcdet](https://github.com/xmuqimingxia/3D-HANet/tree/main/pcdet) folder provided by us to run the 3DHANet code.

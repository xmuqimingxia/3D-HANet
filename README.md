# 3D-HANet: A Flexible 3D Heatmap Auxiliary Network for Object Detection

3D HANet is a flexible plug-and-play Auxiliary Network. Although our open source code is based on the CasA detector, it can be verified with simple modifications to other detectors.

Please refer to [Casa](https://github.com/hailanyi/CasA) and [OpenPCDET](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) for the configuration of the code running environment and training of the model.
